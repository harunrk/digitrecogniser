# Digit Recogniser
I tried to predict Kaggle's famous starter project, the digit recognizer, as a way to understand deep learning. I set the number of epochs to 1 in order to quickly get results (even though it provides low percentage results, it was necessary for a dataset of this size). After finding suitable parameters through trial and error, I adjusted the other parameters except for the epoch in my .py file as shown.

I also took some notes for myself with explanatory comments within the code.
